My final paper and power point combining all we learned in software development  life cycle 

I believe that the best way to interpret the end user needs is to just talk to them. The only way you are truly going to get a good understanding of what they are looking for is if you talk to them directly. Once you get everything that the user is looking for putting them into user stories makes it easier to organize there ideas and come up with a way you plan on tackling everything that they want. I would approach developing a program by using the agile method. I would use the Agile method because it is extreamly flexable and allows for change if you or the end user notices something else they would like the software to be instead. I beleive to be a good team member on a software development team you need to be able to have strong communication skills and to carry your own weight. With an Agile approach things change constantly and you need to be able to work through these changes with your team members, also there are people depending on you to get your work done for the project to be successful so you need to make sure you are doing your part.
